# Strain-Gauge-Circuit
Strain gauge schematic and construction tutorial, part of the City College Initiative to Promote Academic Success (CiPASS) 2021.

We will construct the circuit using the schematic provided in ![the strain gauge schematic](https://github.com/anashraf002/Strain-Gauge-Circuit/blob/main/strain%20gauge%20schematic%20four.png) and we can construct the circuit following the steps outlined in ![part 1](https://youtu.be/0K1QCSRV-qc) and ![part 2](https://youtu.be/vDGz_URfe30). We finally can write the code for the strain gauge to make measurements ![here](https://github.com/anashraf002/Strain-Gauge-Circuit/blob/main/arduino%20tutorial%20compressed.mkv).
